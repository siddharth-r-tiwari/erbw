# ERBW
## Encoding the Effortful Retrieval Hypothesis as a Method to Prevent Model Collapse

The following repository contains my final project for Harvard's NEUROBIO 240. Below, find a summary of relevant files.

## Files

* `erbw/`
    * `final_scripts.ipynb`: contains the scripts necessary to reproduce the final scripts of the report, importantly ERBW's performance relative to other sampling methods
    * `misc_scripts.ipynb`: contains scripts from past assignments and attempts in the semester, particularly from when I tried to prevent model collapse in digit generation rather than real vs. fake digits
    * `weights\` : contains saved weights for the discrimators and generators from across training schemes and epochs. Included final weights (epoch 200) due to file-size concerns.
    * `evolution.gif` : The resulting gif from running the `animate_gif` function in `final_scripts.ipynb` - can observe how generated digits change over generations
